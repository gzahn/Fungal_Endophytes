These files are part of my fungal endophyte project.  Sequence data are from fungal isloates, sanger ITS1F - TW13, bi-directional consensus sequences, quality trimmed.

*The image files are of fungal isolates growing on [wMEA agar][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gzahn/Protocols/master/media_recipes_gz.txt]; for reference.*

###Fungal Endophyte Isolates were taken from wild relatives of Phyllostegia kaalaensis.
PMA = Phyllostegia mollis, plant A, Ekahanui
PMB = Phyllostegia mollis, plant B, Kaluaa
PGA = Phyllostegia grandiflora, plant A, Schofield Army Greenhouse
PGB = Phyllostegia grandiflora, plant B, Schofield Army Greenhouse
PP = Plectranthus parvifloris, plant A, From Matt Kier (location needed)
PHA = Phyllostegia hirsuta, plant A, From Lauren (location needed)
