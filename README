Isolates were taken from wild relatives of Phyllostegia kaalaensis.
PMA = Phyllostegia mollis, plant A, Ekahanui
PMB = Phyllostegia mollis, plant B, Kaluaa
PGA = Phyllostegia grandiflora, plant A, Schofield Army Greenhouse
PGB = Phyllostegia grandiflora, plant B, Schofield Army Greenhouse
PP = Plectranthus parvifloris, plant A, From Matt Kier (location needed)
